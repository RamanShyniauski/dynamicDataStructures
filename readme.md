**Hi there!**

You can check my C++ realisation of the following dynamic data structures:
* Single Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Stack (*based on single linked list*)
* Queue (*based on single linked list*)
* Deque (*based on dynamic array*)
* Binary Tree
* Map (*based on Binary Tree*)

All methods have description in the proper *.cpp* files.
 
Enjoy!
