                                            Hi there!
You can check my realisation of the following dynamic data structures:
- Single Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack (based on single linked list)
- Queue (based on single linked list)
- Deque (based on dynamic array)
- Binary Tree
- Map (based on Binary Tree)
 
All methods have description in the .cpp files. Here you can find some examples of how they work.
 
                                             Enjoy!
